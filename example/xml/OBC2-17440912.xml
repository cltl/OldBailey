The deceased made answer and said, how could he be tired, for his work was but play; and the Prisoner said it was hard work, for he had carried a thousand and a half of bricks two story high that day. They contradicted one another, and the Prisoner gave the deceased the lie, and the deceased said if he gave him the lie again, he would hit him a slap on the face: and the other said if he did, he would return it. After that they talked of laying a wager about fighting, and then they went to fighting by consent: they had three falls, and the third fall they both fell down together sideways, and the Prisoner had rather the worst of it - I don't know any thing of any wound he received - He went home and died in about an hour afterwards. The Churchwarden said the Coroner obliged him to prosecute, and I appear for the parish.</u></p>

I opened the skull in order to see if there was any contusion upon the brain, but found it clear and safe. One lobe of the lungs was quite adhered to the pleura and was quite emaciated (but that was not occasioned by this fall) and there was a little adhesion of the other lobe, but not like that.

I had got the broomstick in my hand, and I said I would knock his brains out if he offered to move, and then the money fell down - I don't know how much: then he pretty artfully catched hold of me and threw me over the rails into the road, but we both tumbled over together. Bucklimes was looking for the money: I still held Roach by the collar, and Bucklimes seeing I had managed him, held this stick up and said, G - d - your eyes , if you don't let him go, I'll knock your brains out; when I had him down I cried out murder, and in some little time the watch came.</u></p>

Five weeks ago last Tuesday, I was going out with my cherries, and left my 2 children at home. My biggest girl came to me and said, Mother, Betty Pugh and Carolina Banham have been with us. I went home and missed the things. I went immediately after them, and found them at the Castle in King-Street by Guild-hall. They had drank 3 pints of beer, and had had a pennyworth of bread and a pennyworth of cheese, and had no money to pay the man. As soon as I saw them, I charged them with robbing me. Pugh said, What do you mean by that, Mrs. Moore? there's no body here has robbed you: and Banham said, It is a lie, for we have robbed her. The next day I had them before a Justice, and then both of them owned that they had bought each of them a gown out of the golden guinea they had robbed me of, (they have the gowns upon their backs now) and each of them an apron, a shift, and a silk handkerchief; the handkerchiefs cost half a crown apiece - There was a guinea and a half in gold, 7 s. in silver, and 2 d. - I found 2 spoons at Mr. Tyson's, facing St. George's church in Southwark , by their direction. They owned they had sold my coral to Mr. Peters in the borough; (Banham told the Justice, that Mrs. Peters melted it down as soon as she had it) and that they had sold the buttons at Mr. Bennet's at the bridge-foot.</u></p>

(The stick the Prisoner had was produced, which was a small bamboo cane with a crook Ivory head, part of which was broke off.) After he had struck at the Prisoner, the Prisoner struck at him again; and after several blows had passed on both sides, the Prisoner laid hold of the deceased and threw him down with his face upon the ground; his face was very bloody and the blood run down very sadly between his Eyes. After he was down the Prisoner beat him with his stick several times, and broke his stick upon him. Then a person took him up, but the Prisoner being stronger than he drove him four or five yards, and he fell down flat upon his back in a cart rut; and then the Prisoner went to strike at him again, though I don't know that he struck him any more, but the deceased lay in a dismal condition; for I believe he was in liquor, and what between that and the blows he could not stir himself.</u></p>

I examined his head to see if he had received any wound there; there was no fracture, and I could not perceive any wound except that in his nose: I did something to relax the jaw and to make him evacuate; but in about three days he died: the upper part of the bone of the nose was bruised, upon which I put my probe into the outward membrane or covering of the bone, and the probe came through into the roof of his mouth, and by the simpathy between one membrane and another, this bruise occasioned the contraction of the jaw, so that it is my opinion the man died of a penury or a perfect starving.</u></p>

They were separately wrapped up in a piece of brown paper; I missed them September the 3d, and saw them there a week before - I suspected the Prisoner because there was nobody else in the room, and when she came to lodge with me she was very poor and mean, and could not pay for washing or lodging. On Saturday the 1st of September she brought in a parcel of goods, I have an inventory of them; there was a pair of callimanco shoes, 4 s. 6 d. a pair of breeded shoes, 8 s. a pair of stays a guinea and a half, a hood and cloak in the nature of a capuchin with a lace round it, two pair of muffatees, half a guinea, there was a silk gown and some shifts, but I don't know the value of them: she gave a woman sixpence to bring them into the house. She dressed herself up and went that Saturday to Ranelagh-House with a gentleman. I asked her how she came by the money. She said she had a guinea and a half of that gentleman. She continued in the house, she did not run away.</u></p>

I thought there was something more than ordinary in the case, and did not believe that he had picked his pocket. I went to Justice Fraser's, and came back again with a design to make an enquiry into it; one Mr. Morris came, and said he wanted to speak with Patrick Askin : he said there was a trunk left at his house and he could not open it for want of the key. I told Patrick Askin the mistrust we had, and then he desired to become an evidence, so we took his\ in\ formation: upon which we went between one and two in the morning, to Mr. Maddoxs's at the Two Chairmen in Drury-Lane, and took Mr. Ryley in bed; MackEvoy jumped out of the window, but he was taken before he could get off. I happened to hear the sash go, or else they would both have got out of the window, and probably have got off. Then we carried them to New-Prison in a coach my own three men, and Mr. Edwards and I went in the coach with them.</u></p>

However we went into the house, and MackEvoy jumped out of the window in his shirt and a handkerchief about his head; and the man of the house stood by the door of the room, where they were, in his shirt and said, I should not go into that room. But Capt. Dodd's men broke open the door, and I took Ryley covered over head and ears in bed, and this hanger was lying by his bed side. I was not careful enough to secure the hanger then, but the woman of the house put it into another room. The landlord had got into bed again, and I said to him, friend, you had better discover the fire-arms. He said there were no fire-arms, but a hanger in a trunk that belonged to Ryley, and we found these three hangers in the trunk.</u></p>

The manner of their coming was thus; Askin came to the door first, and said open the door and take away the light. I did not see any thing brought in for they went up in the dark - I knew who they were by their coming down together afterwards. Askin came down asked for a candle and went up again, and I thought I heard them telling of money. They all came down together I believe in about a quarter of an hour, and they all three sat down in a little room we have below and sent for two full pots of beer. After that Ryley took his leave of the other two and went home, and MackEvoy lodged all night with Askin. After these two went up, I having some suspicion that they were something worse than smugglers, as they pretended to be, stepped up stairs, looked through the door, and saw MackEvoy pull off his clothes and put on a scarlet coat.

I got between the deceas'd and the Prisoner without saying any thing to him or he to me, seeing the knife drawn and having no weapon of defence, neither sword nor stick, I went back, and going back the Prisoner made a stab at me with his knife; upon his making the push at me I got upon the hill, where I saw six or seven Gentlemen with sticks or cane in their hands, upon which I related the affair to them and begged one of them to lend me a stick to defend my life, which I apprehended to be in danger and borrowed one; I came back to the Prisoner (who I still saw with his knife drawn) and said to him, You villain, if you don't put up your knife I'll knock you down - I held the stick up at him but did not strike him. The Prisoner upon my threatning him in this manner put his knife up; upon which I was going to return the stick to the Gentleman I borrowed it of, but before I gave it to him I met with another Dutchman (as I suppose by his apparel) and he had one of his hands in the side pocket of his breeches. Then I heard some people cry out for me to take care of my self for he had his hand upon a knife, upon which I bid him keep off or I would knock him down, and the man did not offer to come any further; so I looked back and saw the Prisoner pursuing the deceased, who was retreating backwards.</u></p>

About an hour and half after the thing was done, as I was going up stairs with him I asked him how he did; the answer he made me was, that he should die, and he repeated it often that he should die and was a dead man - the deceased was a soldier, I was conscious he would die and I sat myself down by his bed-side - this might be about three hours after the wound was received: I asked him whether he gave the first offence, the answer he made me was, as I hope for mercy I did not offend him at all <activity>[that is the Prisoner]</activity> He said he saw a woman in the Prisoner's company and passed them, but the passage being very narrow he believed he might touch both the Prisoner and the woman, and at that instant of time he received a blow from the Prisoner with a stick; this the deceased alledged to me was the Reason of his first stopping; this is all I have to say, my Lord - the deceased was a very civil man, had not been above a month in the regiment, and had an estate in the country of 33 l. a year.</u></p>

 <p>Fortune Willoughby. I happened to hear a noise and run to the gate of the brew-house yard, and I saw the deceased strike the Dutchman two blows with a stick, he offered to strike a third time and his arm fell down. Upon that the deceased clapp'd his left hand to his coat and waistcoat, unbuttoned it and pulled it off, and the blood came through his shirt from his right shoulder down to his breeches; then the landlady of the Hamburgh-arms came out and took the Prisoner into the house. With that the deceased's comrade [Hartcup] came up and broke the windows and the mob rose so high that I thought they would have pulled the house down - I believe Hartcup did it for fear they should favour the escape of the Prisoner - I did not see any thing before the two blows, but I thought this was a very peaceable Dutchman to take two blows without striking again, not knowing that the deceased had received a wound before - when he came into the yard he was very bad; a Surgeon came to examine the wound and I looked on it, which I <xptr doc="174409120032" type="pageFacsimile"/> was sorry I did, for I never saw such a wound in my life - it was a sort of a triangle.

I did not see him that night, my brother Surgeon of the Infirmary dressed him. The next day I took off the dressing and observed a wound in the back about an inch in length at a small distance from the Spine. I did not see that it bled at that time or that it had bled in the night; but upon enlarging the external wound, I perceived that it penetrated into the cavity of the breast between the 10th and 11th ribs through which I could very easily pass my finger next day at the dressing of the wound; upon opening of the wound there was so large a discharge of blood that the man fainted with the loss of it. I took a proper method to prevent a greater effusion being apprehensive of fatal consequences. The symptoms of death encreased so fast that I thought it impossible to do him any good, and he died on Saturday night.</u></p>

 . The Prisoner came into my stable-yard in Grosvenor-Mews, a young woman saw him run one of my fowls down and asked him why he chased the sow! down; he said it was his own, and he said he would have it, for he knew it by the marks; but he could find no mark upon it; then he went away and came again, and took the fowl before my face, put her into his basket and went away with it - he is a man that goes about to fell meat and fowls.</p>
 <p>The fowl being taken publicly in the day time, it could not be a felonious taking, and is rather actionable than indictable. Therefore the Prosecutrix (though with much reluctancy) acknowledged her self in the wrong, and asked the Prisoner's pardon in court, and he very readily forgave her.</p>
